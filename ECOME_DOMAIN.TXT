## UPDATED E-COMMERCE SUBSCRIPTION PLANS

### Plan A: FlowShop Basic — $5/month

- Full AI-powered e-commerce store
- AI Store Builder autopilot
- Full product management with AI content generation
- Google Trends & Search product discovery
- Competitor pricing comparison & dynamic pricing
- Ad feed integration (Google Shopping, Facebook, TikTok)
- Mobile-first responsive storefront
- AI product recommendations
- Region-aware payments (mobile money, COD, cards)
- Free FlowSmartly subdomain (storename.flowsmartly.com)
- Connect your own domain (BYOD) — user handles DNS
- No free domain included — user can purchase a domain through FlowSmartly at marketplace pricing or bring their own

### Plan B: FlowShop Pro — $12/month

Everything in FlowShop Basic, plus:

- 1 FREE domain included (up to $14.99/year value — covers .com, .store, .shop, .online, .co)
- Domain auto-configured, SSL auto-provisioned, zero setup
- WHOIS privacy protection included
- Auto-renewal included (domain renews free as long as the $12/month subscription is active)
- Priority AI processing (faster store generation, product discovery, ad creative)
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- AI customer support chatbot for the store
- Abandoned cart recovery email sequences
- If user cancels the $12/month plan, domain reverts to standard renewal pricing ($14.99/year billed separately) or user can transfer domain out for free

**Why $12/month makes sense:** The user is essentially paying $7/month more than the basic plan. That's $84/year extra. A .com domain costs FlowSmartly ~$10/year from Cloudflare. So FlowSmartly earns ~$74/year net from the upgrade — far more than the $4.88/year markup from selling the domain separately. The user feels like they're getting a deal because they see "1 FREE domain" and they're paying less than buying the $5/month plan + a $14.99/year domain separately ($5 x 12 + $14.99 = $74.99/year vs $12 x 12 = $144/year, but the user gets more features and the domain feels free).

## HOW THE DOMAIN INTEGRATES INTO THE EXISTING STORE FLOW

### Integration Point 1: Onboarding Step 5 (Store Address)

The current Step 5 asks users to choose between subdomain or custom domain. With the new plans, this step now becomes plan-aware:

**If user is on FlowShop Basic ($5/month):**

```
🌐 Store Address

Choose how customers will find your store:

[Option 1] FlowSmartly Subdomain (Free)
  mystore.flowsmartly.com — instant setup

[Option 2] Buy a Domain — starting at $9.99/year
  Search and register a domain right here
  (charged separately to your payment method)

[Option 3] Connect My Own Domain (Free)
  I already own a domain — show me DNS instructions

💡 Upgrade to FlowShop Pro ($12/month) to get 1 FREE domain included
```

**If user is on FlowShop Pro ($12/month):**

```
🌐 Store Address — 1 FREE Domain Included with Your Plan!

Choose how customers will find your store:

[Option 1] Claim Your Free Domain ⭐
  Search and register — included with your Pro plan
  (no extra charge, auto-renews free while subscribed)

[Option 2] FlowSmartly Subdomain (Free)
  mystore.flowsmartly.com — instant setup
  (you can claim your free domain later in Store Settings)

[Option 3] Connect My Own Domain (Free)
  I already own a domain — show me DNS instructions
  (your free domain credit stays available for later use)
```

### Integration Point 2: Agreement Page Update

The agreement page now shows both plan options before the user activates:

### Integration Point 3: Store Settings — Domain Management Page

After activation, the Domain page in Store Settings adapts to the user's plan:

**FlowShop Basic user sees:**

```
🌐 Domain Management

Current: mystore.flowsmartly.com (active ✅)

### Integration Point 4: Billing & Subscription Page

The user's billing page reflects the e-commerce add-on clearly:

```
📋 Your Subscriptions

FlowSmartly Pro Plan .............. $29/month
FlowShop Pro Add-On .............. $12/month
  └ Includes: 1 free domain (mybrandstore.com)
───────────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly ..................... $41/month

Next billing date: March 23, 2026
Payment method: Visa ending in 4242

Additional charges:
  Extra domain (myotherbrand.store) .. $9.99/year
  Next renewal: Feb 23, 2027
```

### Integration Point 5: Cancellation & Downgrade Logic

**If FlowShop Pro user downgrades to FlowShop Basic:**

1. User receives warning: "Your free domain (mybrandstore.com) will no longer be included. It will convert to a paid domain at $14.99/year, billed on your next domain renewal date. You can also transfer your domain to another registrar for free."
2. If user confirms downgrade: plan drops to $5/month, domain stays active but flagged for paid renewal
3. 30 days before domain renewal, user gets email: "Your domain mybrandstore.com will renew at $14.99. [Renew] [Transfer Out] [Let Expire]"

**If FlowShop Pro user cancels e-commerce entirely:**

1. User receives warning about both store deactivation and domain status
2. Store is deactivated, data retained for 90 days
3. Domain remains registered (Cloudflare still manages it) — user gets option to: renew at $14.99/year as standalone, transfer to another registrar for free, or let it expire
4. Subdomain stops working immediately upon cancellation

**If FlowShop Basic user cancels:**

1. Store deactivated, data retained 90 days
2. Any purchased domains remain registered — renewal at marketplace pricing
3. Subdomain stops working immediately

### Integration Point 6: Upgrade Nudges Throughout the Platform

Strategic points where Basic users see Pro upgrade prompts:

- **Store Dashboard:** Banner at top: "Upgrade to Pro — Get a FREE domain + AI chatbot + abandoned cart recovery"
- **Domain Settings:** When they try to buy a domain: "This domain costs $14.99/year, or upgrade to Pro ($12/month) and get it FREE"
- **Analytics:** "Unlock Advanced Analytics with FlowShop Pro"
- **Orders:** When they get their first abandoned cart: "You just lost a sale! FlowShop Pro includes automatic abandoned cart recovery emails"
- **After 30 days on Basic:** Email: "You've been running your store for 30 days! Here's what you're missing on Pro..."

### Integration Point 7: AI Indexing Step Update (Onboarding Step 6)

The AI indexing step now also includes domain configuration when a domain was selected:

**FlowShop Basic (no domain purchased):**
1. Extracting brand colors & typography
2. Analyzing content voice & tone
3. Mapping audience demographics
4. Configuring regional payment gateways
5. Building product recommendation model
6. Indexing social performance data
7. Generating store theme from brand DNA
8. Setting up delivery & payment rules
9. Configuring subdomain routing
10. Store ready for launch!

**FlowShop Pro (free domain claimed):**
1. Extracting brand colors & typography
2. Analyzing content voice & tone

5. Registering domain via Cloudflare (mybrandstore.com)
6. Configuring DNS records automatically
7. Provisioning SSL certificate
8. Building product recommendation model
9. Indexing social performance data
10. Generating store theme from brand DNA
11. Setting up delivery & payment rules
12. Enabling AI customer support chatbot
13. Configuring abandoned cart recovery
14. Store ready for launch on mybrandstore.com!

## REVENUE MODEL SUMMARY

**Per user monthly revenue scenarios:**

- FlowSmartly Pro ($29) + FlowShop Basic ($5) = $34/month = $408/year
- FlowSmartly Pro ($29) + FlowShop Pro ($12) = $41/month = $492/year
- FlowSmartly Pro ($29) + FlowShop Basic ($5) + domain purchase ($14.99/yr) = $34/month + $14.99/year = $422.99/year
- FlowSmartly Enterprise ($49) + FlowShop Pro ($12) = $61/month = $732/year

**At scale (assuming 60% Basic / 40% Pro split across e-commerce users):**

- 1,000 e-commerce users: 600 × $5 + 400 × $12 = $7,800/month = $93,600/year
- 5,000 e-commerce users: 3,000 × $5 + 2,000 × $12 = $39,000/month = $468,000/year
- 10,000 e-commerce users: 6,000 × $5 + 4,000 × $12 = $78,000/month = $936,000/year

Plus domain markup revenue on top of that ($5-7 per domain per year for purchased domains).
